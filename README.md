## Netflix Movie Review App 

This is a fulllstack app that allows a user to login and head to their profile page. I wanted to replicate Netflix in a way. The user is able to write a review of a movie from Netflix by entering in the name of the movie, genre and a description of their thoughts on that movie. Then the user can add that review to the review list where other reviews will be, and if they also have the option of deleting the review or adding it to their favorites list.
